# Reframe Checklist to Demonstrate LocalStorage

This checklist is a demonstration on using localStorage to persist check values across user sessions

### Project Goal
 This is a sister project to a project I'm currently developing in Clojure for my internship. It is a proof of
 concept in vanilla React, before changing the functionality over to Re-frame and Reagent

 ### Demo 

 In this gif you can see a checkbox being checked and unchecked while the localStorage stores and removes a key for the task
